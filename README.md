<h1>Stones</h1>
<br>
A small site for tones (Only Major scale)
<br>
Quick and small project just for fun 
<br>
Trying to merge my basic music theory knlowledge to my basic web development skills
<br>
<br>
Still in production, there is still a basic problem with Sharp and Flat notes on certain harmonic fields (e.g.A#, F...).
<br>
No database is being used for now (hence there is no login and save function)
<br>
Still thinking about how to show the chord images and about the other chord possibilities inside the harmonic field  (e.g. add9, add7, different bass)
<br>
Modulations will NOT be included
